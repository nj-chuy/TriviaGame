# TriviaGame

I used multiple sources to get the final code in place.

The game is created to have a timer and run for 10 seconds between questions.

The questions are set using methods and objects. The var trivia has many objects including objects which have the quesitons / choices and answers.

The code has some of the other attempts noted out, but runs well enough.
